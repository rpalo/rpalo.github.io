    <description>I'm currently/always doing a lot of learning, and it seems like writing it down in blog form is a good idea to help cement the things I'm learning. Also, all the cool kids are doing it.  My goal is once every two weeks or better.

        <title>First Screencast</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I created my first (and second) screencast tutorial!  I wanted to share my experience a little bit and encourage everybody else that’s secretly wanting to do a screenshare but not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-i-did-it&quot;&gt;How I Did It&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t even have to buy any software or hardware at all.  I’m sure there are programs out there that would let me do higher-quality editing, exporting, etc., and I’m sure there are microphones that would improve audio quality.  Those are probably a good idea, and I’ll have to look into them.  However, for this first one, I had such a low threshhold for chickening out and giving up, I had to make it as easy as possible for myself to do it.  Here’s my setup:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Created a new account on my Macbook, specifically for these screencasts.  No accidental notifications during the screencast, no personal files and info showing up that I don’t want, no initial settings or configurations skewing how my machine works compared to anybody watching.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Microphone: Apple earbuds mic.  No external powersource or cords or stand or setup needed.  Just plug them in and go.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Screen Recording Software: QuickTime Player comes stock on a Mac (I think).  You can record screencasts with it by opening it and clicking &lt;strong&gt;File -&amp;gt; New Screen Recording&lt;/strong&gt;.  You can then set it to use whatever mic you want (including those handy dandy platinum-quality earbuds).  You can also have it highlight your mouse clicks if you want.  I chose to do that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Video Editing Software: iMovie.  Simple-ish.  Easy-ish.  Got it for free.  I used it mostly to strip out the really long pauses whenever I didn’t know what to say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your first screencast will suck.  That’s ok.  Just push through, throw away your first couple of takes (but not much more than that), and get it edited and exported to YouTube (or wherever).  Don’t try to perfect it, just get it out there.  It won’t be perfect, and that’s ok, because, unless you shamelessly plug your screencasts on a popular blogging platform, no one will watch them.  BUT.  That’s the good thing.  Because, once you make the first one and get through the “curled-up-in-a-ball-of-social-anxiety-will-they-hate-it-oh-my-gosh-the-trolls-are-coming” phase, you’ll be less scared to make the second one.  And the second one will be a bit better.  And as you make more and more, you’ll get more confident — at this point I’m speculating, but, this is my hope — and the videos will get better.  And leave them up, because you can always make another, better video.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are some things you should leave out.  Trust me.  &lt;strong&gt;Don’t&lt;/strong&gt; do an intro to the video in the same video you’re recording.  If you have to do an intro, do it in a separate video in the same playlist that people can opt out of/not watch.  Your video already has a title and a description.  People (mostly) can read.  They know.  Just jump right into the material.  Somebody told me this, and I didn’t believe them.  And I did an intro to my first video.  And when I went back and watched it, &lt;em&gt;it was so boring&lt;/em&gt;.  It also adds minutes to your video, which adds to the time it takes to export and upload it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-need-from-you&quot;&gt;What I Need from You&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a couple of favors to ask, if you’ve got time and are willing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you know of a decent microphone (not platinum quality, but something that will get me 80% of the way there and sounding professional) that I can get on Amazon or something, let me know.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ditto for screencast/editing software.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’ve got time, check out my video (see below).  The second one is better than the first, but I know there’s a lot of improvement to be made yet.  Message me (email, tweet, comment, etc.) if you have any feedback.  I know that’s a big favor, so I appreciate it, and I don’t take it lightly.  I want to get better and make things that people enjoy watching and can learn something from.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’ve been thinking about making a screencast for a while but have been too nervous or didn’t know how, sit down and make one!  (Or stand up, I don’t care, live your life homie).  Put it up on YouTube.  And know that everything will be ok.  If you send me a link, I will shower you with complements, praise, and click the like button.  You’ve got the Palo guarantee on that one*.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-reveal&quot;&gt;The Reveal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the second part, because it’s shorter and better and the first part makes me cringe.  Thanks for reading/watching!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Comparison Time</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You hear a lot of people giving some form of this piece of advice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Don’t compare yourself to others.  Comparing yourself with someone with more experience only leads to disappointment and discouragement.  Comparing yourself to someone with less experience leads to a false sense of pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that this is great advice.  But, I think that I can refine it a little to add a bit more value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;definitely-compare-yourself-to-others&quot;&gt;Definitely Compare Yourself to Others&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s a pretty substantial refinement!” you say.  To this I say, “Yes.  Yes it is.  It is also a shameless attention-grabbing subtitle.”  Let me clarify.  I think you should compare the appropriate moment in time of “you” to others.  Do you see someone who is super amazing and it seems like they know everything?  Are you thinking to yourself, “Oh, man, I can’t believe how much stuff they know.  I barely know anything in comparison.  Therefore, I suck and should just give up.”?  Take a moment.  How many years of experience does that person have?  Or — possibly a better metric — how many projects/teams/technologies has this person worked on.  In how much depth?  How many mentors has this person had?  OK, with that information, we can reframe the question to an even comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Picture yourself after that same number of years, projects, technologies, teams, and mentors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, how does this future you compare to this person right now?  Does it seem like “future you” could be just as smart/skilled/knowledgeable?  That’s a good comparison to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example-grumpy-senior-engineer-15-years-with-the-company&quot;&gt;Example: Grumpy Senior Engineer (15 years with the company)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our example, let’s imagine you recently got hired at &lt;em&gt;software.io&lt;/em&gt;, neat, trendy software company.  You’ve been working there for a few months.  There’s another employee that’s been with the company for 15 years!  They are grumpy, and that’s being polite about it, but they really know their stuff.  Based on their skill and their seniority, you generally look up to them.  This, combined with their grumpiness makes them kind of intimidating.  You’re trying to do your best as you work and things are generally good, but every so often, they’ll snap or make an off-handed comment about &lt;em&gt;junior developers&lt;/em&gt; or explain something using the words &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; a lot.  This is discouraging, because it starts to seem like you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; know all of this stuff.  I mean, this senior engineer does!  Maybe there’s something wrong with you.  You’re probably dumb.  Maybe this programming thing just isn’t for you.  You start to keep an eye open for data entry jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/worms.gif&quot; alt=&quot;We are worms!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop.&lt;/strong&gt;  That’s enough of that nonsense.  Let’s practice our scale leveling.  This employee has worked at this company for 15 years.  Is it possible that, given 15 years, you could get to a point where you know as much as this employee does?  Or even more?  How much work would you have to put in over that time period for that to be the case?  Does that seem reasonable?  Easy?  Difficult, but doable if you really work?  If you answered yes to some of those questions, then stop worrying.  You’re exactly where you need to be.  Or, using this logic, you can figure out that you have actually been just cruising and need to be putting more time/effort into your learning.  Less episodes of NBC’s hit TV series Parks and Recreation and more side projects.  One fewer scroll through InstaTwitFaceSnapBlr and one more coding challenge on &lt;a href=&quot;http://exercism.io/&quot;&gt;Exercism&lt;/a&gt;.  Any way you look at this, you’ll get some valuable insight and hopefully feel more motivated and less… um… de-motivated?  Bad?  Like 💩.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example-2-question-filled-newbie&quot;&gt;Example 2: Question Filled Newbie&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes the other way.  Let’s say you have a bit more experience.  You know your way around a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; definition.  You’re a real hotshot.  But there’s this intern who is a sophomore in college who never. stops. asking. questions.  Questions that any poor fool knows the answer to.  Any poor fool, that is, except apparently for this intern.  But they are your poor fool and you’re supposed to be a mentor to them.  Let’s apply our scale leveling again.  Think of the questions this person is asking.  How long have they been with the company?  How long have they been programming?  It takes a certain amount of time and practice to figure out that most things are Google-able, and it takes even more practice to figure out how to ask the right questions.  Think about yourself at that level (I know it’s tough).  Think about what it was like to learn the very, very basics.  Think about learning about functions and the difference between parameters and arguments and why one didn’t have to match the other, but sometimes they did because that was the best name for the variable.  Think about hearing about each new technology that you were “supposed” to know.  For me, I learned Python, but as I started to get into Django (a web framework), I was like, “Oh, crap, now I’m supposed to know HTML, CSS, SQL, and JavaScript.”  And then there’s something called jQuery, which is JavaScript, but it’s not.  And there’s something called JSON, which is also JavaScript, but it’s not.  And then, and then, and then…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/and-then.gif&quot; alt=&quot;And then and then and then&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve done this, three things happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The questions the intern asks stop being so annoying (or maybe, they become less annoying).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Feeling superior to them becomes less important (which is good since feelings of superiority are pretty much never useful).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You begin to see the questions from their eyes, which helps you pinpoint the most effective answers, shortening the list and duration of each of the questions as you explain things better.  This saves both of you time and helps them to feel less like a burden (because — trust me, if they are anything like me — they do).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to wrap up, this is very good advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Don’t compare yourself to others, only to past and future you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I propose that this is possibly even better advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Don’t compare current you to others.  Only compare equivalent versions of you to others and evaluate the work needed to get there (or the work it took to get where you are).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this helps.  Anything I can do to help keep Codenewbies from giving up is one more person who can use technology to help make the world a better place.  Let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Learn to Code, Part 2 - Looping Targets</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part two in my series on Learning to Code.  Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://assertnotmagic.com/2017/09/09/p5-part-1-random-walker/&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; if you missed it.  Somehow, my wife is still with me after the first one, so let’s keep at it!  I’m going to drop this excerpt from the previous part here, because I think it’s really important to repeat as often as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you’re just starting to learn to program, let me tell you something.  Programming is Hard.  So please don’t feel discouraged or stupid.  This tutorial moves &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; fast and covers a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;, so feeling overwhelmed or not understanding everything on the first pass-through is &lt;strong&gt;totally normal&lt;/strong&gt;.  My goal here is to take you through the motions and have you experience the thrill programmers feel of creating something dynamic and awesome out of nothing.  Once you’re through, ask me every question you can think of until things make more sense.  You can email me or send me a Twitter message.  Links are in my bio on the &lt;a href=&quot;/about/&quot;&gt;about page&lt;/a&gt;.  I’ll work through the homework with you (since the homework will really help get things solidified some).  Just put your head down, get through it, don’t give up, and don’t feel weird asking for help.  If something doesn’t make sense, it’s not because you’re a doofus – it’s because I didn’t write well enough.  Now.  For real this time.  Let’s get started&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;lesson-2-looping-targets&quot;&gt;Lesson 2: Looping Targets&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you survived Lesson 1!  Hopefully you’re hungry for more.  In this lesson, we’re going to take what we learned in the previous lesson and cement it in place.  We’ll take &lt;strong&gt;if statements&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;assigning variables&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;using functions&lt;/strong&gt; to the next level.  I’ll try to mix in a few new cool P5 functions as well.  Lastly, we’ll get to see our first &lt;strong&gt;loop&lt;/strong&gt;.  This lesson will also work a little different than the previous one in that, instead of getting the final product at the beginning of the project and working through it backwards, we’re going to do what programmers often do, which is build something small and slowly increment it.  I will, however, give you a little taste of what is to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/teaser.png&quot; alt=&quot;final product teaser&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to make it so that when you click on the canvas, a randomly sized target gets drawn, with a random number of rings.  These rings should go from black on the outside to white in the center, and get darker linearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-loops-and-noloops&quot;&gt;Step 1: Loops (and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;noLoops&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get the hard stuff out of the way up front so you have longer to get familiar with it.  Here’s our goal for Step 1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/step1-goal.png&quot; alt=&quot;step 1 goal&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might not look that different, but we’re removing a lot of our requirements initially.  We’re taking a big problem, and we’re breaking it into a few smaller, easier to solve problems.  I (and many others) call this “eating an elephant”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As a programmer, you have to know how to eat elephants.  How do you eat an elephant?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One bite at a time, man.  One bite at a time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are our requirements for Step 1?  We must draw a static, unmoving set of 10 circles in the middle of the canvas.  The overall diameter must be 400px.  The rings must go from white to black, linearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-first-try&quot;&gt;Our First Try&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, let’s get started with the easy stuff: the setup.  We need a canvas, a grayish background, we don’t need our drawing looping, and none of the circles really have outlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createCanvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;125&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;noStroke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;noLoop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two lines should look familiar.  We wanted a medium gray background, and remember that our grayscale goes from 0 to 255 by default.  125 falls relatively into the middle of that range.  The last two functions need only a little introduction.  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;noStroke&lt;/code&gt; turns off the borders, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;noLoop&lt;/code&gt; makes it so our draw loop doesn’t update.  If none of our shapes are moving, we can save some CPU cycles if we tell the canvas not to run draw over and over.  You’re welcome, CPU!  We love you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool!  So canvas: check.  Gray background: check.  Static, non-moving drawing: check.  What’s next?  The requirements of the circles.  Let’s declare some variables to make our lives easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// pixels&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sizeStep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// We'll use this to define our ring sizes&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;colorStep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;255&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;centerX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// pixels &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;centerY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// pixels&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We covered all of the above in Lesson 1, so no worries there.  You might ask, “Ryan, if we’re not using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt; function to loop (because of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;noLoop&lt;/code&gt;), how come we don’t just do everything in the setup function and forget the draw function altogether?”  You’re right!  You totally could.  From what I can tell, the two are functionally equivalent.  I chose to do things this way because it makes more sense in my head to only do “setup-ish” things in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;setup&lt;/code&gt; and “drawing” things in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt;.  Whatever floats your boat.  You’re the artist here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, it’s finally time to create our circles.  Luckily, P5 provides us with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/ellipse&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ellipse&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/a&gt;, which takes an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x, y, x width and y height&lt;/code&gt;.  Since we are geometry geniuses, we know that if we draw an ellipse whose width and height are the same, it’s the same as drawing a circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// pixels&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sizeStep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// We'll use this to define our ring sizes&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;colorStep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;255&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;centerX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// pixels &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;centerY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// pixels&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Draw the circles, start with the biggest, black one on bottom&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ellipse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;centerX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;centerY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;colorStep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ellipse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;centerX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;centerY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sizeStep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sizeStep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;colorStep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ellipse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;centerX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;centerY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sizeStep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sizeStep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;colorStep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ellipse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;centerX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;centerY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sizeStep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sizeStep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// oy vey...  Getting tired of typing yet?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope.  I refuse to let you copy paste all that code.  We’re learning about the &lt;strong&gt;for loop&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;for-loops&quot;&gt;For Loops&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try this in your console:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Yeeeeeeaaaaaahhhhh boooyyyyyyyy'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/first-loop.png&quot; alt=&quot;Yeah boy loop output&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s break it down now.  This was a &lt;strong&gt;for loop&lt;/strong&gt;.  Now you can see why they’re called that.  We’re saying “for each time through this loop, perform the following actions”.  There are three main parts of a &lt;strong&gt;for loop&lt;/strong&gt;.  The &lt;strong&gt;initialization step&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;test step&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;incrementing step&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;initialization step&lt;/strong&gt; is the first section you come to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything here gets run once at the start of the loop.  Generally you’re just setting the initial looping variable value, but you can do whatever you want here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next is the &lt;strong&gt;test step&lt;/strong&gt;.  This runs before every loop.  If the test step is true, the loop continues on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time the computer reads the code, we will have just set &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;i = 0&lt;/code&gt;, so — 0 being less than 10 — the loop activates, running everything inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that happens comes the &lt;strong&gt;incrementing step&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw this in Lesson 1 when we were stepping our walker over one pixel.  This simply increases &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; by 1.  Then, we loop back to the &lt;strong&gt;test step&lt;/strong&gt;.  Now, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is equal to 1, which is still less than 10, so the loop happens again.  And again and again until after &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; equals 9.  After that last loop, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is 10, which is not &lt;em&gt;less than&lt;/em&gt; 10.  Satisfied, the loop exits and we can continue on with our program.  Are you beginning to see how we can use this in our program?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-second-try&quot;&gt;Our Second Try&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createCanvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;125&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;noStroke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;noLoop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// pixels&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sizeStep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// We'll use this to define our ring sizes&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;colorStep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;255&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// pixels &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// pixels&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// The new stuff!&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;colorStep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 0, 25.5, 50.0, 75.5 ...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;thisSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sizeStep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 400, 360, 320 ...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ellipse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;thisSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;thisSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sense?  First the loop goes through with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;i === 0&lt;/code&gt;.  Thus, we call &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fill(0)&lt;/code&gt; and our fill is black.  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;thisSize&lt;/code&gt; gets set to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;400 - 0 * 40&lt;/code&gt;, and our largest circle is 400.  And we draw a circle.  The next time through, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;i === 1&lt;/code&gt;, so we call &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fill(25.5)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;thisSize === 400 - 1 * 40 === 360&lt;/code&gt;, and so forth!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only one problem, a problem that has plagued programmers since the dawn of programs.  The &lt;strong&gt;off-by-one&lt;/strong&gt; error.  Note that in the last iteration of the loop, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; will be equal to 9.  Thus, the fill color will be &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;9 * 25.5&lt;/code&gt; which is only &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;229.5!&lt;/code&gt;  Not &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;255&lt;/code&gt; like we want.  Our center dot is &lt;em&gt;off-white&lt;/em&gt;!  The humanity!  The problem stems from the fact that we have 10 rings, but the first one starts at zero.  We’re only really stepping &lt;em&gt;nine times&lt;/em&gt;.  Thus, we need to fix our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;colorStep&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;colorStep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// now our fill will be 0, 28.33, 56.66, 85 ... 255&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same issue affects our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sizeStep&lt;/code&gt;, but in that case, we want that to happen.  We want our last circle to have a diameter of 40px, not 0px.  If we did want 0px to be our stopping point, we would have to make the last adjustment there as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off-by-one errors are super confusing to get your head around and one of the most common causes of errors, so don’t worry if this was a bit dense and confusing.  If you have any questions, hit me up and I’ll see what I can do to clarify.  But for now, we’re moving on!  ONWARDS!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-mouse-clicks-and-functions&quot;&gt;Step 2: Mouse Clicks and Functions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve achieved our first milestone goals, let’s step up the complexity a bit to try to get closer to our final goal.  For this step, we want to draw a target 400px large with 10 rings, — same as before — but we want to draw it only when the user clicks on the canvas, and we want to place it &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; the user clicks on the canvas.  Two new goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-mouse-functionsvariables&quot;&gt;The Mouse Functions/Variables&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P5 provides us with a function called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mouseClicked&lt;/code&gt; function.  This function gets called whenever your mouse clicks the canvas.  P5 also provides us with two built-in variables &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mouseY&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mouseX&lt;/code&gt;.  You get three guesses for what these contain.  Let’s take our previous sketch and tweak it a little to see what we’re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// This stuff is all the same as before&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createCanvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;125&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;noStroke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;noLoop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// pixels&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sizeStep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// We'll use this to define our ring sizes&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;colorStep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// pixels &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// pixels&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;colorStep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;thisSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sizeStep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ellipse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;thisSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;thisSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Here is the new hotness&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mouseClicked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ellipse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mouseX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mouseY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/first-click.png&quot; alt=&quot;our first mouse clicked function&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you can see where I’m going with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;review-of-functions&quot;&gt;Review of Functions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, I’m going to do a little cleanup (also known as a &lt;strong&gt;refactor&lt;/strong&gt;) that will make our life marginally easier and, more importantly, help us to review &lt;strong&gt;functions&lt;/strong&gt;.  Let’s pull our target drawing out of the draw loop and put it in a function called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;createTarget&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// pixels&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sizeStep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// We'll use this to define our ring sizes&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;colorStep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// pixels &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// pixels&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;colorStep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;thisSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sizeStep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ellipse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;thisSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;thisSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See?  Nothing too much different.  But let’s do one better.  Let’s make the target customizable via &lt;strong&gt;parameters&lt;/strong&gt;.  Remember them?  Those are the function inputs that you put inside the parenthesis.  Luckily, we have our inputs all stacked at the top of the function so they are easy to spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refresh the page, and nothing changes!  Great!  That’s when you know you’ve had a successful &lt;strong&gt;refactor&lt;/strong&gt;.  So why did we do this?  Because it makes it really easy to do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or even:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Get it?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// x = 40, 140, 240, 340, 440&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// y = 50, 175, 300, 425, 550&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// maxSize = 100, 150, 200, 250, 300&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// steps = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/functions-and-loops.png&quot; alt=&quot;a loop inside a function!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To try to clarify what’s happening in a function, I’ll try to explain it another way, that helped me.  When you first define a function, the things you put into parenthesis are like a recipe.  You’re saying what you expect.  Similar to a recipe book saying: get some kind of meat and some kind of vegetable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;iAmTheBest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, when you actually &lt;strong&gt;call&lt;/strong&gt; the function, it’s like you’re actually making the recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;iAmTheBest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function looks at the things you’ve passed in and goes, “OK.  I’m going to do this with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x = 25, y = 30, and r = 50&lt;/code&gt;.”  To carry on with the strained recipe metaphor, it’s like you read the recipe and you start cooking with beef and broccoli, but following the steps in the recipe with those options.  If you use beef and broccoli, it’ll be similar to but not exactly the same as if you were to use chicken and carrots.  Have I beat this metaphor to death successfully?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;finishing-up-step-2&quot;&gt;Finishing Up Step 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great.  Let’s wrap up this Step by completing our objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createCanvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;125&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;noStroke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;noLoop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// nothing in here anymore!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mouseClicked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mouseX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mouseY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ellipse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;thisSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;thisSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/complete-step-2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;step two is complete&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-adding-randomness&quot;&gt;Step 3: Adding Randomness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you remember our initial goal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’re going to make it so that when you click on the canvas, a randomly sized target gets drawn, with a random number of rings.  These rings should go from black on the outside to white in the center, and get darker linearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that we’re pretty much all the way there!  We just need to add randomness.  Let’s make a new function to handle this extra complexity.  Thanks to our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;createTarget&lt;/code&gt; function, this new function should be relatively straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createRandomTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;350&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, let’s use that in our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mouseClicked&lt;/code&gt; function instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mouseClicked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createRandomTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mouseX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mouseY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHABLAM!  CIRCLES GALORE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/complete.gif&quot; alt=&quot;final product&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not too shabby huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;homework&quot;&gt;Homework&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go back to your Random Walker.  Make it so that when you click on the screen, it clears the screen and he resets in the center of the canvas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do #1, but make it so he starts wherever you click the mouse.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make a random walker that is not a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;point&lt;/code&gt;, but a target!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Update your target function to use colors.  BONUS: make it a rainbow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Figure out how to make your target rectangular/square instead of a circle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As before, I’m super dooper available to answer any questions you might have.  Let me know what went well, and let me know what I could have explained better.  Additionally, let me know how this lesson compared to the last lesson!  Was this progressive building approach better than seeing the project up front like last time?  Did you like getting the hard stuff (&lt;strong&gt;for loops&lt;/strong&gt;) at the beginning and having the difficulty relax a little after that?  Maybe you thought loops were easier than the last sections!  I’d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Learn to Code, Part 1 - Random Walker</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It finally happened.  My wife is letting me teach her how to code!  Or, at least, letting me audition for the part of “guy teaching her how to code”.  I decided to write out my first lesson to make sure it goes well.  If this one goes well, than there will be more.  So here’s to hoping that this post is one of multiple in this series I’m unoriginally entitling &lt;em&gt;Learn to Code&lt;/em&gt;.  I’ll be drawing a lot of inspiration from Dan Shiffman’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://thecodingtrain.com/&quot;&gt;Coding Train&lt;/a&gt; as well as his book &lt;a href=&quot;http://natureofcode.com/&quot;&gt;The Nature of Code&lt;/a&gt;.  I highly recommend you check both of these things out ASAP.  Now, wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;lesson-1-random-walker&quot;&gt;Lesson 1: Random Walker&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first lesson will cover setting up a project, a quick flyby of HTML and JS and how they fit in together, setting up the “Dev Environment” (text editor and browser, no packages), and getting into it.  To cap everything off, we’ll build a random walker in two dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-note-for-newbies&quot;&gt;A Note for Newbies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re just starting to learn to program, let me tell you something.  Programming is Hard.  So please don’t feel discouraged or stupid.  This tutorial moves &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; fast and covers a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;, so feeling overwhelmed or not understanding everything on the first pass-through is &lt;strong&gt;totally normal&lt;/strong&gt;.  My goal here is to take you through the motions and have you experience the thrill programmers feel of creating something dynamic and awesome out of nothing.  So, here’s what I’ll ask.  Please, even if you get stuck or don’t understand what’s happening, just go through and type out the code examples.  Get to the end and build our Random Walker.  Once you’ve got that little dude wandering around your screen, ask me every question you can think of until things make more sense.  You can email me or send me a Twitter message.  Links are in my bio on the &lt;a href=&quot;/about/&quot;&gt;about page&lt;/a&gt;.  I’ll work through the homework with you (since the homework will really help get things solidified some).  Just put your head down, get through it, don’t give up, and don’t feel weird asking for help.  If something doesn’t make sense, it’s not because you’re a doofus – it’s because I didn’t write well enough.  Now.  For real this time.  Let’s get started&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-the-setup&quot;&gt;Step 1: The Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a few things we’ll need to get started: a browser (I like Chrome, myself) and a text editor (we’ll use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sublimetext.com/&quot;&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt; just to get started).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/sublime.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sublime Text screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and get those installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more neat thing before we start.  In Chrome, you can use this thing called a &lt;strong&gt;console&lt;/strong&gt; to test out any of the code that we go over before adding it into a project.  There’s a lot of ways to open the console, but the fastest is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;command + option + j&lt;/code&gt; on Mac and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;control + shift + j&lt;/code&gt; on Windows/Linux.  You can also get it by right-clicking and selecting &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;inspect&lt;/code&gt;, or by opening the developer tools from the Chrome dropdown menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/console.png&quot; alt=&quot;console&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should come in handy if you get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-htmljs-flyby&quot;&gt;Step 2: HTML/JS Flyby&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk a little about HTML.  We won’t need to know much right away.  Just a little bit.  The first thing to know is that all websites are made up of files that are just text.  In general, the layout of a web page is defined in a text file ending in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.html&lt;/code&gt; that contains a special langage and format.  HTML is short for Hyper Text Markup Language, but all that really means is it’s text that written in such a way that a browser can read and parse it and convert it into a pretty, rendered format.  I’m going to talk more about the specifics now, but it’s super important that you don’t try to memorize HTML.  There are so many little rules and options to remember that trying to memorize everything in one go will definitely overwhelm anybody.  I would recommend just picking up the conceptual nuggets and letting the rest wash over you, picking things up organically as you go.  As you use it more and more, you’ll find yourself remembering more and having to Google less.  Leggo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-super-basics&quot;&gt;The Super Basics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTML is made up of building blocks called &lt;strong&gt;elements&lt;/strong&gt; that look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  Hi there!  'p' stands for Paragraph!
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each &lt;strong&gt;element&lt;/strong&gt; is defined by its &lt;strong&gt;tags&lt;/strong&gt; which are the things in angle brackets (&amp;lt;&amp;gt;).  Some &lt;strong&gt;elements&lt;/strong&gt; have an opening and closing &lt;strong&gt;tag&lt;/strong&gt;, like the one shown above.  This is so that these elements can wrap around the outside of other elements, creating this nested hierarchy that will come in handy much later.  Some elements are “self-closing”, so you don’t need a second one.  One example is the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;hr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element, that makes a “horizontal rule” or line accross the page.  Since it’s really hard to put anything &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; a line, it makes sense to have that as a self-closing tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;structural-tags&quot;&gt;Structural Tags&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few tags that make up the foundation of every page.  Every page should have at least this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!doctype html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Title in Page Tab&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- This is how we comment in HTML.  Nobody sees this but us --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Hi there!
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!doctype html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;: This tells the browser it’s looking at an HTML file, and what version of HTML we’re using, based on the format.  This simplified format means we’re using the most recent version: HTML5.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;: These tags contain all the rest of our html.  Nowadays, you can even leave these off and the browser is smart enough to figure out what you mean, but it’s best to make sure you have this anyways.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;: This section doesn’t show up on the page.  It is a header that contains many of the settings and information that the browser, search engines, devices, and other internet things need to interact with your web page.  Once we get there, we’ll put our links to &lt;strong&gt;stylesheets&lt;/strong&gt; there, to make our pages look pretty.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;: This is where the meat of your page goes.  Everything in the body will exist on your webpage.  If you were to save the above snippet as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;basic.html&lt;/code&gt; and double-click it to open it, you would see this:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/basic-html.png&quot; alt=&quot;Basic HTML rendered&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other thing to pay attention to is how we were able to nest the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; tags inside the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; tags, and we even nested the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; tag inside the head!  Each webpage is a tree-like hierarchy like this that can sometimes get really, really nested.  Also note that it’s considered best practice to indent your tags to the same lines (each nesting indented 2 or 4 spaces) to make it easier to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adding-in-scripts&quot;&gt;Adding in Scripts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we’ll add in the scripts that will allow us to use deeper programming concepts like &lt;strong&gt;variables&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;loops&lt;/strong&gt;, and more!  There’s a special tag called a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; tag that loads files such as &lt;strong&gt;JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt; files.  &lt;strong&gt;JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt; is the current internet standard for adding code functionality to your web page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Before we go any further, I just want to make a note.  This is directed at anyone with lots of programming experience that reads this.  Throughout the next few examples, we will cover some code that may not exactly be “best practice” or “industry standard”.  That’s not what I’m trying to do here.  I’m just trying to get some code that is easy to understand and works.  For instance, AirBnB’s JavaScript style guide recommends defining functions like this: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;var foo = function bar() {};&lt;/code&gt;.  They provide good reasons for why you should do it this way.  It makes a lot of sense.  BUT.  You have to have a good amount of background before it looks like anything other than gobbledygook.  For someone just starting out, it makes a lot more sense to do it the way we’ll do it below.  So all you smarty farties that want to correct: leave it alone for now.  There will be time for that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript works like this.  Imagine you have the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;basic.html&lt;/code&gt; file from above in your current directory.  Who knows, maybe you really do!  Next, create a file in the same directory called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;annoying.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// This is how we comment in JavaScript&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Any line that starts with two forward slashes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// doesn't affect the code.  It's for humans!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Why are comments different in every language?  Who knows.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello friend!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure not to forget your semicolons at the end of each line.  JavaScript is slowly (hopefully) moving away from needing the semicolons, but for now, we’re stuck with them.  I’m sure we’ll talk more about the history and progress of JavaScript later.  For now, let’s add a line to our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;basic.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!doctype html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Title in Page Tab&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- This is how we comment in HTML.  Nobody sees this but us --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Hi there!
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;annoying.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save the file and either re-open it in your browser, or, if you’ve already got it open, click refresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/alert.png&quot; alt=&quot;Annoying alert&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at you!  You’ve now learned exactly as much as the annoying, good-for-nothing spam website creators know.  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;alert(&quot;Your computer may have a virus!&quot;);&lt;/code&gt;  Ha.  Ha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to finish explaining, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/code&gt; portion of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; tag tells the browser where to look for the file to load.  If you wanted to, you could have omitted that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/code&gt; portion and just put the code in between the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; tags.  Anything you put in between those tags is assumed to be JavaScript.  I’m going to show you an example that is cool.  Don’t worry if it doesn’t make total sense yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!doctype html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Title in Page Tab&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- This is how we comment.  Nobody sees this --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Hi there!

    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;annoying.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// JavaScript *inside* HTML!&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'p'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;bottom text&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a short explanation, I create a new “paragraph” element, like we saw above.  I set the text inside that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element to be &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;bottom text&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, and then I attach it to the bottom of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; tag, modifying the original code after the browser has read it.  If you right-click the page and click &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;inspect&lt;/code&gt;, you should see some HTML, but there’s a new &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element sitting there at the bottom that we didn’t have in our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;basic.html&lt;/code&gt; file!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/modified-html.png&quot; alt=&quot;MAGIC PARAGRAPH ELEMENT&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool right?  OK, I think we know as much as we need to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-introducing-p5&quot;&gt;Step 3: Introducing P5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With JavaScript (and pretty much any other programming language), you can load in and build on top of other people’s work.  This is great!  This is great because otherwise, everyone who wanted to make something would have to write all of the supporting/utility/framework-ey code as well.  There would be a billion people all writing libraries that helped capitalize words and take the square root of things.  One way you load in an external library is by including the relevant &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; tag before the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; tags for your own code.  Since HTML files are read and processed from top to bottom, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; tags that come first get loaded first and become available for your code to reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other thing to note.  Before, we showed that you can include your code in between the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; tags, like this: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert(&quot;Woohoo!&quot;);&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  We also showed that you can load a local file like this: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script src=&quot;path/to/the/file.js&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  What I didn’t include is that the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; can also be a path to a website, so you can load the file from the web!  This is one easy way to load external libraries without having to download a bunch of files or keep track of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter: P5.js.  P5 is an animation library, with a really easy interface that is based on an earlier project called &lt;a href=&quot;https://processing.org/&quot;&gt;Processing&lt;/a&gt;.  You can go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://p5js.org/&quot;&gt;P5.js homepage&lt;/a&gt; for more info, examples, and documentation.  We’ll do more with that later.  I’ll show you the basics with a second example.  Create a new folder called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;example2&lt;/code&gt; and create a file called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; inside it.  (More on why it’s called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; later, because that’s important-ish).  Also create a file called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sketch.js&lt;/code&gt;.  Here’s your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!doctype html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;en&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;My First P5.js Sketch!&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- This is the external P5 library we're loading  --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.5.14/p5.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Here's the link to our script --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;sketch.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it!  This will actually be the starting point for pretty much all of your projects, so feel free to save this file somewhere you can copy it from later as a starting point.  Let’s take a look at your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sketch.js&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createCanvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;stroke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of new things there that we should talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;functions&quot;&gt;Functions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In programming, the computer reads the code line by line from top to bottom.  (There are some things that happen that are exceptions to that, but that’s not important now.)  You could, in theory write every instruction one after another, typing everything out.  However, &lt;strong&gt;functions&lt;/strong&gt; are blocks of code that we can reuse.  We’ll talk about the benefits of doing this as we go.  You can think of functions like a combination of microwave presets and math functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;microwave-presets&quot;&gt;Microwave Presets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you push Quick Minute on your microwave, it turns the light on, starts the turntable, activates the microwave, puts 1:00 on the timer, and begins counting down.  Once it gets to 0:00, it turns the microwave off, turns the light off, stops the turn table, and beeps.  If it’s one of those horrible microwaves, it beeps every 15 seconds after that until someone opens the door.  Can you imagine having to push one or more buttons for each of those steps?  Isn’t it so much nicer to simply push Quick Minute?  If the manufacturer wanted to add a step that starts a disco ball inside the microwave, they could just add that line to the Quick Minute function instead of making you remember to add that in everytime you pushed the button sequence.  It might look something like this in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;quickMinute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lightOn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;turnTableOn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;microwaveOn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;microwaveOff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;turnTableOff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lightOff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// beepUntilOpened();  Only if you're unlucky...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functions in JavaScript are defined by the word &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;function&lt;/code&gt;, a name (in this case: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;quickMinute&lt;/code&gt;), any function inputs in parenthesis (in this case: there are none), and then the code in the function within the {} brackets.  You can then call this function whenever you want by simply typing the name of the function and a pair of parenthesis () like this:  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;quickMinute()&lt;/code&gt;.  In JavaScript, adding those parenthesis acts as a trigger, meaning “Call this function now please!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;math-functions&quot;&gt;Math Functions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functions can take input and produce output as well!  Remember the parenthesis?  You can put names for the things that you expect inside them.  You can output a value with the word &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;.  Watch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, if you &lt;strong&gt;call&lt;/strong&gt; the function (call means run) with inputs, you’ll get outputs as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// =&amp;gt; results in 12!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But be careful!  It’s up to you to name things in a way that makes sense.  Take a look at this misleading function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;misleadingMultiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Butt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;misleadingMultiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// =&amp;gt; 'Butt'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the responsibilities of a good programmer!  Okay!  Back to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sketch.js&lt;/code&gt; code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setup-and-draw&quot;&gt;Setup and Draw&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P5.js expects two main functions to be defined by you.  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;setup&lt;/code&gt; is run once, right at the beginning, by P5.  It’s a good place to set things up.  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt; is run repeatedly, over and over, after that.  Currently we’re not making use of that, but we’ll do it in the final project in this lesson.  Let’s look at the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;setup&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt; that we defined above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createCanvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P5 animations (also called &lt;strong&gt;sketches&lt;/strong&gt;) occur on a canvas (which is a special HTML element that you can draw shapes on).  The easiest way to do that is via  function provided by P5, called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;createCanvas&lt;/code&gt;.  You just have to tell it a width and a height (in pixels).  In our example, we made it 600 wide and 400 tall.  That’s all the setup we did for this one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;stroke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every loop, we redraw the background with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;background&lt;/code&gt; function.  There are several ways to call this function, but this way is with a number between 0 and 255 (I’ll explain the significance of that number later).  0 is full black, and 255 is full white.  That means that we’re drawing a white background.  Next, we set the stroke or pen color for the edges of our shapes.  You can see that we’re setting it to be black.  After that, we set the fill color for our shapes to white.  Lastly we actually draw a rectangle.  When you draw a rectangle, you call it with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;(x-position, y-position, width, height)&lt;/code&gt;.  How do I know what numbers are needed in parenthesis?  I’m magic and know everything.  Also, it’s on their website.  Check out their &lt;a href=&quot;https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/rect&quot;&gt;documentation for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rect&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/a&gt;.  Any time you have a question, start with the documentation.  There is a lot of good stuff there.  In fact, all four of these are functions provided by P5: &lt;a href=&quot;https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/background&quot;&gt;background&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/stroke&quot;&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/fill&quot;&gt;fill&lt;/a&gt; all have their own documentation as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay!  That about covers it!  Save your files and open up &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; in your browser!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/a-rectangle.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our first sketch&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TADA!&lt;/strong&gt;  Aren’t you so excited?!  After all of that, we made… a rectangle.  A square to be precise.  I hear you say: booooooo.  Okay smarty pants.  Let’s move onto the main project for this lesson: The Random Walker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-the-random-walker&quot;&gt;Project: The Random Walker&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve stayed with me so far, it might be a good idea for you to take a break at this point and have a snack or something.  We’re going to learn a lot in this project.  Here’s a list of firsts you’ll encounter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;variables&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;true and false&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;comparing numbers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;doing math&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;branching (i.e. if statements: if &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;something is true&lt;/code&gt;, do one thing.  Otherwise do another)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pixels and why things are upside-down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s it!  Stay tuned.  To get setup, create a folder called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;project1&lt;/code&gt; and inside that, copy your baseline &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; and create a new file called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sketch.js&lt;/code&gt;.  I’m going to lay out the entire project code up front so you can see where we are going, and then I’ll explain the parts one after another, much like I did in the last section.  Here’s the code for your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sketch.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createCanvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;stroke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alrighty.  There’s a lot here.  If you’re a super genius, you can kind of get a sense of what’s going on, but I’ll explain it for the normal humans like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;variables&quot;&gt;Variables&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re declaring our variables up front.  A lot of times, this isn’t the best practice, and we should avoid it if we can.  For our initial sketches, though, it’ll probably be ok.  A variable is like an address or mailbox slot that could hold a value.  You use the word &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; to tell JavaScript you want to create new ones.  If you’re anything like me, you’ll forget to write &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; all the time.  If you just write &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;var x&lt;/code&gt; and not &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;var x = 3&lt;/code&gt; or something, then then the value of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; (at least until you assign something to it i.e. put a value in that particular PO box called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;) will be the JavaScript concept &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;.  More on that later.  Hopefully right now you can see that we’re saying right at the beginning, “Hey!  I’m going to have three values that I care about and want to get access to later: x, y, and rand.”  Don’t forget the semicolon at the end of the line!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-setup-function&quot;&gt;The Setup Function&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createCanvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;stroke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s not actually that much that is new here.  Hopefully you’ll recognize &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stroke&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;createCanvas&lt;/code&gt; from the last example.  There’s only two new things here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is that we are finally assigning our first values to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;, using the single equals sign (=).  You can think of the single equals sign as an arrow that points to the left, saying, “Take whatever value you end up with on the right side of the equals and put it in the PO box named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.”  P5 provides us with some handy variables &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; that contain the width and height of the canvas that we’re working in.  Since we know we created it to be 600px wide and 400px tall, hopefully you can see that after this function gets run, the value of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is 300 and the value of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; is 200.  I wanted to start exactly in the middle of the canvas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-draw-function&quot;&gt;The Draw Function&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of new stuff in this function.  You can see we finally assign a value to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/code&gt;, but what is it?  P5 provides two useful functions for us: &lt;a href=&quot;https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/floor&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;floor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/random&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;random&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  The way that we’re using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;random&lt;/code&gt;, it takes in an optional maximum value, and it returns a random value between zero and that maximum, noninclusive (i.e. [0, max), i.e. between 0 and 3.99999).  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;floor&lt;/code&gt; takes any number in and returns that number rounded down to the nearest integer (e.g. 3.4 becomes 3 and 2.9 becomes 2).  All together, you are assigning a random choice of (0, 1, 2, 3) to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;comparing-things&quot;&gt;Comparing Things&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a large section in this function that has 4 of these equations in parenthesis.  In JavaScript, the triple equals compares two things.  If the thing on the left is the same as the thing on the right, it evaluates to the JavaScript value &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.  Otherwise it evaluates to false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;branching-with-if-else-if-else-statements&quot;&gt;Branching with IF, ELSE IF, ELSE Statements&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what is known as an &lt;strong&gt;if statement&lt;/strong&gt;.  The way it works is by starting at the top.  &lt;strong&gt;If&lt;/strong&gt; the first test in parenthesis evaluates to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, then the code within the brackets {} is run and nothing else is.  Otherwise, the code moves on to the next &lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt;.  If none of the &lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; statements ends up being true, and there is an &lt;strong&gt;else&lt;/strong&gt; statement present, that runs instead.  You can mix and match your &lt;strong&gt;ifs&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;else ifs&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;elses&lt;/strong&gt; as you see fit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can omit the &lt;strong&gt;else if&lt;/strong&gt; statements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Jim&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi Jim!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi stranger!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can even omit the &lt;strong&gt;else&lt;/strong&gt; statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;65&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Here's your senior discount!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Here's your child's discount!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s no else and, for example, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;age&lt;/code&gt; was 29, nothing would happen in the block of code above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to bring us back to the code in our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt; function, what we’re doing is checking each possible value of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/code&gt;.  If &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/code&gt; is 0, do this.  If &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/code&gt; is 1, do this.  If &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/code&gt; is 2, do this.  Otherwise (we know &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/code&gt; is 3), do this other thing.  In theory, only one branch will be run, depending on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/code&gt;’s value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;modifying-variables-in-place&quot;&gt;Modifying Variables In-Place&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a short cut.  There’s a couple of ways to modify variables in JavaScript.  You can do it the long-form way that you’ve seen before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can even use the variable in both sides of the equation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// The right side evaluates to 15, so then&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// x gets set to 15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a shorthand to the method above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// += is short for add the following&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// to the current value of x&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Thus, x === 15 now.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s even a shorter shorthand if you want to just add 1 to the variable (i.e. increment it).  That’s what you see above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// x === 13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drawing-points&quot;&gt;Drawing Points&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, there is a function provided by P5 called &lt;a href=&quot;https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/point&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;point&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that places a 1px dot at the provided &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;(x, y)&lt;/code&gt; coordinates.  Speaking of which:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;canvas-x-and-y&quot;&gt;Canvas X and Y&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the browser, all points are referenced from Top and Left.  In fact, x and y are aliases for Top and Left, respectively.  Top is the number of pixels something is from the top of the window, and left is the number of pixels from the left side.  What this means is that X makes sense as x+ to the right, but Y is backwards from what you would assume.  Y+ is down, meaning that y = 10 is almost at the top of the screen and y = 100 is further towards the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/coordinate-system.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Canvas coordinates&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, in our code above, if &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/code&gt; is 0, we add 1 to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, causing the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;point&lt;/code&gt; to move right one.  If &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/code&gt; is 1, we subtract 1 from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, causing the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;point&lt;/code&gt; to move left one.  If &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/code&gt; is 2, we add 1 to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;, thus causing the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;point&lt;/code&gt; to move down one.  And if &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/code&gt; is 3, we subtract 1 from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;, causing the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;point&lt;/code&gt; to move up one.  Overall, this code causes the point to randomly choose a direction and take one step that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wrapping-up&quot;&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createCanvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;stroke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting it all together, remembering that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;setup&lt;/code&gt; gets run once and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt; gets run over and over after that, our code starts with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;point&lt;/code&gt; in the middle of the screen.  Every time we run through &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt; (known as one &lt;strong&gt;animation frame&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;frame&lt;/strong&gt; for short), the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;point&lt;/code&gt; moves randomly in one of the four cardinal directions, and we re-draw the point.  Save your code and open up &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; in your browser!  If everything is right, you should see our little buddy noodling his way around the middle of the canvas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/walker.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Our random walker!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel accomplished yet??  You should.  You did awesome!  (Awesomely?)  Here’s some homework:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;homework&quot;&gt;Homework&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try making our walker more active: make his steps larger.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make it so our walker is biased towards the right side.  Make it so that he is equally likely to go up, down, or left, but slightly more likely to go right.  (Hint: try using &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; instead of ===).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change our walker’s color!  Now, change our walker’s color every single frame.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make our random walker’s step size vary randomly by some amount.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make it so that if our walker reaches the edge of the canvas, he/she gets teleported to the other side of the canvas.  (Hint: use a very small canvas to save time in testing).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Currently the walker’s steps are preserved.  This is because we aren’t redrawing the background every time.  Make it so that you can’t see the walker’s previous steps.  Now make it so you can’t se the steps and the walker is moving around in a rave (i.e. random background color!).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using the P5 documentation: instead of drawing a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;point&lt;/code&gt;, draw a circle.  Do something creative with the circle’s fill color.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you get stuck or have any questions!  Let me know if I explained anything confusingly or could do better.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CSS Animations are Probably Magic</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Stop what you are doing right now and listen to me because CSS animations are actual magic and are amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/css-magic.gif&quot; alt=&quot;MAGIC&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve got your attention, let me explain myself a little more coherently.  If you’ve read many of my other posts you’re probably thinking, “Wait a minute.  You post about Python and Ruby and back-end languages and scripting.  What’s all this front-end nonsense?”  To which I reply, with great affront, “&lt;strong&gt;Nonsense?!&lt;/strong&gt;  Your face is nonsense.  The people who do front-end things are geniuses (Genii?  Genies?) that make our world look pretty and make our user experiences streamlined, and other things that I take for granted and don’t even know about.  But even still, CSS animations are magical enough that they should be shared with all, not just one lucky subset.”  So, what follows will be a introduction and guide that should get even the grumpiest sysadmin to a point where they feel comfortable animating with CSS all on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-background&quot;&gt;The Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSS.  It’s a language.  It’s scary, maybe, for some.  A lot of times, for me, it ends up looking more like a wishlist of how I want my page to look rather than a well-planned and crafted stylesheet.  To guarantee that we’re all starting at the same place, I’m going to sprint through the very basics.  Things you should know before moving on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HTML is a markup language used to layout web pages.  It looks like this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hi there!&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CSS is used to dictate how your website should look.  It looks like this:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;peachpuff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;20px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;chartreuse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’ll note that I specify what &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;element&lt;/code&gt; gets targeted for these styles at the beginning.  I’m targeting my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; from above.  (Don’t worry.  A &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; is just a container/box.)  The webpage would now look like this:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/css-peachpuff.png&quot; alt=&quot;Colors!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can get more specific with targeting your elements by adding classes and ID’s to your elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;underlined&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;main-div&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hi there!&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;I'm a sad div...&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can access these classes and ID’s from within your CSS like this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;peachpuff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.underlined&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;border-bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;#main-div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;36px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;bold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final product will end up looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/css-selectors.png&quot; alt=&quot;Selectors at work&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note how the main div gets all three style improvements, but &lt;em&gt;both divs&lt;/em&gt; get the color, because the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; section targets everything it applies to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK!  That should get us up to speed.  There are a few more things than that that allow us to get more complicated, but I’m going to leave that alone for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-note&quot;&gt;A Note&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we continue, it should be known that not all browsers currently support some of the animation CSS.  I highly recommend using a site or tool like &lt;a href=&quot;https://autoprefixer.github.io/&quot;&gt;this AutoPrefixer&lt;/a&gt; to generate the relevant vendor prefixes that will allow all of this to work in more browsers.  Copy/paste your generic CSS into the input window, run the autoprefixer, and copy the output css to the file that you reference in your HTML document.  Or use a tool that does all of this for you, if you’re a fancy pants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-get-to-animations&quot;&gt;Let’s Get to Animations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, you can animate a lot of things a lot of different ways.  Let’s start simple and go from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-simple-way-transitions&quot;&gt;The Simple Way: Transitions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transitions are a way of switching your changes on and off, simulating animations quasi-manually.  There are several &lt;em&gt;pseudo-selectors&lt;/em&gt; that you can use to apply styles based on what the user is doing.  Try this, continuing with the HTML we had before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;:hover&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#111&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#CCC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/css-hover.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Showing hover effect&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool right?  However, for those of you with an eye for design, you might complain that the transition is a bit abrupt and clunky.  All we have to do is add one line!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;peachpuff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ease-in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ease-in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it smoothly transitions!  Cool right?  But we want more control!  We want animations to happen without hover!  We.  Want.  Keyframes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keyframes&quot;&gt;Keyframes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keyframes are where the money is at.  You just specify what changes you want made throughout the animation, with values from 0% to 100%.  You can also replace 0% with “from” if you like, and 100% with “to”.  Up to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@keyframes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;flip-flop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rotate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0deg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rotate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;180deg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rotate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;180deg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rotate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;360deg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note is that my 40% and 60% are the same.  That’s because I want my div to pause in its motion for part of the duration.  As you can see, all I did was specify the what the attributes should be throughout the animation.  The browser should fill in the rest.  To attach this animation to your div, insert the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;#main-div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;36px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;bold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;animation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;flip-flop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;infinite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that I added a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position: absolute&lt;/code&gt; to increase wow factor.  The key line is the animation line.  You specify the name of the keyframe animation to use, how long, and how many times.  There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp&quot;&gt;a lot more settings&lt;/a&gt; that you can use as well.  Let’s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/css-flip-flop.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Spinny divs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok there &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;main-div&lt;/code&gt;, calm yourself down.  Stop showing off.  One thing, sometimes shapes get weird as they get animated in Firefox.  If that happens to you, just add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;outline: 1px solid transparent&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrap-up&quot;&gt;Wrap Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s it!  You’re well on your way to CSS animation mastery.  Soon you’ll be animating SVG’s (not very different than this), buttons, and more!  If you’ve made some cool stuff like this, share!  Or, if you have some tips on how to do this better/cooler/more performantly, also let me know.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-beginners-introduction-to-css-animation--cms-21068&quot;&gt;This tutorial on Tutsplus&lt;/a&gt; is a really fun tutorial that you should do right now after reading this article.  To see more cool/inspiring/disgustingly amazing things, you should sign up for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/accounts/signup&quot;&gt;CodePen newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.  I don’t even really do much on there, but the weekly newsletter makes me so happy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Metaprogramming Python - Method Missing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m reading a book called &lt;a href=&quot;https://pragprog.com/book/ppmetr2/metaprogramming-ruby-2&quot;&gt;Metaprogramming Ruby&lt;/a&gt; by Paolo Perrotta, and it’s really interesting!  I’m learning a lot.  Every so often, as I’m reading, I come accross a technique and I think to myself, “That’s neat!  I wonder if I can do something similar in another language like Python?”  After some research, I thought I’d share one such discovery with everybody else.  But first, some background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-background-what-is-metaprogramming&quot;&gt;The Background: What is Metaprogramming?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metaprogramming is a neat thing that some (all?  not sure) dynamic languages can do.  Essentially, it’s a bunch of different ways of writing code that will, at runtime, write your code for you.  Let’s take a look to see what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Dude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Sup, brah!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lots&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;built&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'sup'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See that?  At runtime, we just peeked into an object and could see its methods!  Keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'sup'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Brad&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Chad&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Brad'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we have modified our objects based on the methods and attributes of those same objects.  Our code has caused code to be written (a little bit).  FEEL THE POWER.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-technique-method-missing&quot;&gt;The Technique: Method Missing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re familiar with Ruby, you might know that Ruby objects have a built-in method called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;method_missing&lt;/code&gt; that gets called – predictably – if you call a method that doesn’t exist inside that particular object.  You can do all sorts of things with this.  One is to dynamically generate methods at run-time based on things out of your control.  It saves on boilerplate code and constant refactoring.  We need an example to make things more clear though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-crazy-api-designer&quot;&gt;Scenario: Crazy API Designer!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you’re working with a teammate that drinks way too much coffee.  They manage the API that your program consumes, but they keep adding and changing the endpoint names.  The layout is always the same though, so that’s predictable at least.  For instance, last Monday, the main resource was &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beets&lt;/code&gt;, and so you implemented a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;get_beets()&lt;/code&gt; method on your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Supermarket&lt;/code&gt; class.  This method fetches the current &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beet&lt;/code&gt; objects in inventory…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Supermarket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;api_root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;api_root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;api_root&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;get_beets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'{self.api_root}/beets/'&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;api_get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;api_get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Imagine this method hits the api with the provided arguments&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'{url} called with args: {args}'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# for this example&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least… it did until that yahoo decided to use the slightly more descriptive object name: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beetroot&lt;/code&gt;.  And so, you go back to your code and update the method name and API call.  Then, they add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rootabegas&lt;/code&gt; on the fly, even though most of your code is the same.  But!  You are sneaky, you are smart, and you know about &lt;strong&gt;Metaprogramming&lt;/strong&gt;!  And so you reach for your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Supermarket&lt;/code&gt;’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;__getattr__&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Supermarket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;api_root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;api_root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;api_root&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pattern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;compile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;r'get_([a-z]+)'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# matches any get_[something] call&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;__getattr__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;method_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pattern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;method_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;temp_method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'{self.api_root}/{match.group(1)}/'&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;api_get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;temp_method&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;AttributeError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'No such attribute: {method_name}'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Let's test it!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Supermarket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'example.com'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get_beetroots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'example.com/beetroots Called with args: (3)'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;this_should_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;AttributeError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;No&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;such&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;this_should_error&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What just happened?  Let’s hit the key points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;__getattr__&lt;/code&gt; is a builtin method in Python objects that gets called if Python can’t find the method or attribute you’re looking for.  We’ll talk about this a little more in a minute.  But Python expects that this method will either return a function to be called or raise an AttributeError like normal.  As you can hopefully see, that’s what we’ve done above.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We defined a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rexegg.com/regex-quickstart.html&quot;&gt;regular expression&lt;/a&gt; to match the API call method pattern that we expect.  We don’t know what the object/endpoint will be, but we do know that it will start with “get_” and end with the object’s name.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;__getattr__&lt;/code&gt; gets passed the name of the method that gets called.  If the method name matches our regex, we move to step 4.  Otherwise we carry on with raising an AttributeError.  That gets shown in the last REPL call for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;this_should_error&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the method call matches our regex, we want to build and return a function to call.  It doesn’t necessarily matter what you call this inner function.  It might if we decided to permanently add it to our class, but we’re not doing that now.  This function lays out the boilerplate we are looking to avoid.  It should take the parameters we expected functions like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;get_beets&lt;/code&gt; to accept.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;match.group(1)&lt;/code&gt; returns the item in the first (and only) group of parenthesis in our regex, which happens to be the name of the objects we care about.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally, we return the function, which immediately gets called with the arguments that the user initially specified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, we should probably have the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Supermarket&lt;/code&gt; fetch a list of available endpoints so we can alert the user if they make API calls for something that isn’t an available endpoint.  This might also help with security some.  I’ll leave that as an exercise for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overriding-__getattr__s-methods&quot;&gt;Overriding &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;__getattr__&lt;/code&gt;’s Methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have two more possible scenarios for you.  Both have the same solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-example-method-or-overriding&quot;&gt;Scenario: Example Method or Overriding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you want to lay out an example method, so people who are reading your code can see an example of what one of the dynamically generated methods will look like?  OR.  What if you want to override a method, defining your own behavior.  Both are possible, since &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;__getattr__&lt;/code&gt; only gets called after Python searches the object for the desired attribute.  Take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Supermarket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;get_squash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;NO.  NO SQUASH.  It is the devil's gourd.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;get_peanuts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;
        Example of a dynamically generated API call method
        created by __getattr__
        &quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'{self.api_root}/peanuts/'&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;api_get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Supermarket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'localhost'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get_squash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;NO.  NO SQUASH.  It is the devil's gourd.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get_peanuts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'localhost/peanuts called with args: []'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get_bananas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'big ones'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'localhost/bananas called with args: [&quot;big ones&quot;]'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;soup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;AttributeError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'No such attribute: {method_name}'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all works as planned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;caveat-meta&quot;&gt;Caveat Meta&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should know that with great metaprogramming power comes great metaprogramming responsibility.  This kind of thing, if not well-laid-out and cleanly implemented, can make code super hard to read, reason about, and debug.  If you find yourself writing out more comments than code to explain how your object works, you should maybe ease up on the Meta.  In fact, I’ve read in several places that if you are unsure of whether or not you need metaprogramming, you probably don’t.  And if you are pretty sure you do need it, you still maybe don’t.  But, in specific instances, like when you need a bunch of methods that are all almost the same and you don’t know ahead of time which ones should exist, it can be very powerful and save you a lot of maintenance, headache, and typing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, give it a try and maybe it will be a useful tip for you!  Let me know how it goes 😁&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. - I really recommend checking out the &lt;em&gt;Metaprogramming Ruby&lt;/em&gt; book I mentioned at the beginning of this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.P.S. - If you found yourself going “What the F are these F-strings (e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;f'WHAT IS THIS'&lt;/code&gt;)”, fear not.  They’re Python’s newest string interpolation/formatting syntax.  I’ve got plans to write a post gushing about them in the near future.  They’re similar to JavaScript’s new &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#{syntax}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Step Your Meta Game Up</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Meta tags.  SEO.  For me, these were things I knew existed, and I knew I should be doing something about them, but it was never high on the list of things to do – until I read up on them and found out how cool they can make your website!  They’re quick little things that can give your site just a touch of panache and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/confident-swanson.gif&quot; alt=&quot;I know what I'm about, son.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to cover two types of meta tags here: general utility tags and social tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;utility-tags&quot;&gt;Utility Tags&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First let’s cover some things that help search engines, devices, and other robits work well with your site.  I’m just learning about this, but it seems like these should probably exist on every page that you ever make.  Someone correct me if I’m wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;charset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;utf-8&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;http-equiv=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;IE=edge&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;viewport&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ROBOTS&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;INDEX, FOLLOW&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;description&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Ryan's site that extols the values of cheese.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;keywords&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;cheese, virtues, poetry, spoken word, slam poems about cheese&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some explanation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charset&lt;/strong&gt;: Specifies the character encoding of the website.  UTF-8 is nice, it’s the recommended setting, and it helps with languages that have characters that are outside the basic ASCII set.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IE=Edge&lt;/strong&gt;: A meta tag that seems like it used to be required to tell Internet Explorer to behave, but from what I can tell, Microsoft seems to be phasing this out.  This might not even be necessary any more.  I don’t think it hurts to have it, though, and it may help with some browser compatibility.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viewport&lt;/strong&gt;: Sets the initial viewport and scaling.  According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/TAgs/tag_meta.asp&quot;&gt;w3&lt;/a&gt;, this makes it so your site doesn’t show up teeny tiny on mobile initially.  Always a good idea.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROBOTS&lt;/strong&gt;: Tells well-behaving web-crawlers how to index (or not) your site.  You would set this according to whether or not you want the page to be visible from Google, for example.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;: Your site’s description.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;: Keywords that help people find your site from searches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially if you’re using Jekyll, JavaScript frameworks, or some other method of templating, it’s pretty easy to drop these in once and forget about them and they improve your searchability and accessibility.  But!  They don’t do anything especially shwoopy like the next section does.  Behold!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;social-tags&quot;&gt;Social Tags&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some people who’s links look sad when they share them on social media.  Like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/sad-link.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sad link sharing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in a few short minutes, their links could look like &lt;strong&gt;this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/amazing-link.png&quot; alt=&quot;AMAZING LINK!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;twitter:card&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;summary_large_image&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;twitter:title&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;assert_not magic? | Gouda?  You mean great!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;twitter:site&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;@paytastic&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;twitter:description&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;A point-by-point comparison of Gouda and other cheeses.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;twitter:image&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;http://assertnotmagic.com/gouda.png&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;twitter:image:alt&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Delicious Gouda&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;twitter:creator&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;@paytastic&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;og:url&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;http://assertnotmagic.com/gouda/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;og:title&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;assert_not magic? | Gouda?  You mean great!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;og:description&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;A point-by-point comparison of Gouda and other cheeses.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;og:image&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;http://assertnotmagic.com/gouda.png&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s actually a lot more you could do.  It’s hopefully clear that the lines beginning with ‘twitter’ are for the Twitter API, and it’s probably not clear that the ‘og’ ones are for Facebook for some reason.  There’s also Google+ and others.  These are just the two that I’m using now.  Note the ever-important &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;twitter:image:alt&lt;/code&gt; for screen-readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, once you’ve got this in place (or, at least the Twitter ones), head on over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview&quot;&gt;the Twitter Card API documentation&lt;/a&gt; and take a peek.  Finally, head to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator&quot;&gt;Twitter Card Validator&lt;/a&gt; to make sure you did it right and check to ensure everything is working as planned.  It may take a bit for Twitter and the other sites to crawl and whitelist your site (or blacklist you if you’re a moral delinquent), but then, sharing your site on social media will be super duper shnazzy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m working on figuring out Google’s Rich Cards (i.e. how your site and pages are displayed in their search results), and once I get that all in place and figured out, I’ll write a post about that as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/google-cards.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google cards&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;Sorry, apparently I’ve got food on my mind.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I missed some meta tags you think are important, or if you’ve got some other cool ones to share, I’d love to hear about it!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Your Own REPL in Twenty Lines or Less</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been in a Python interactive REPL and said to yourself, “You know, this is nice and all, but… it’s missing something.  There’s not enough &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;!”  Well, worry no more!  I’ll show you how to do it in twenty lines or less!  Let me introduce the main attraction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;code&quot;&gt;Code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As unhelpful as that sounds, it’s true.  Python has a module in the standard library called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Code&lt;/code&gt;.  You can check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/code.html&quot;&gt;code module documentation&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t believe me.  The documentation is maybe a little tough to understand on first pass-through, so I thought I’d create a few examples to show it off.  There are a few objects in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; module, but only one that I’m going to talk about this time: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;interact&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interact&quot;&gt;Interact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive in.  I’ll show you.  Let’s create a new file in our directory called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shell.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/usr/bin/env python&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# I'll be using Python 3, for reference.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# seems silly, but works great&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;custom_repl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pie&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;delicious&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;3.14159&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;homonyms&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pie&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;interact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;banner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello!  My name is Jeeves!  I am fancy.  🎩&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;locals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;exitmsg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Ta-ta!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;__main__&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;custom_repl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try running it and watch the magic work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;python3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;shell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;py&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;My&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Jeeves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;am&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fancy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;🎩&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;3.1415&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pie&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'delicious'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;homonyms&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sqrt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;1.7724531023414978&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Ctrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Ta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the banner message we specified shows, the exit message we specified shows (although it didn’t work for me if I used the built-in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;quit()&lt;/code&gt; commands), and we had access to the local variables when &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;interact&lt;/code&gt; was called.  And we can use anything to act as our local state!  Go back in and create &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shell2.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/usr/bin/env python&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# shell2.py&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mileage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mileage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mileage&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;honk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Beep!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;__repr__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&amp;lt;Car - color: {}, mileage: {}&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mileage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;__main__&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;red&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;20000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;interact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;banner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Now interactively inspecting {}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;car&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the shell… &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;python3 shell2.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Now&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;interactively&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inspecting&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Car&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mileage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;20000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;car&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Car&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mileage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;20000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;honk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Beep!'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;local&lt;/code&gt; parameter to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;interact&lt;/code&gt; has to be a Dict – such as the one returned by &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;local()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;global()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrap-up&quot;&gt;Wrap Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use this to provide a nice interactive aspect to your app to help you do shell things, inspect objects, debug, and much more.  This is roughly how &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html&quot;&gt;pdb&lt;/a&gt; works too!  Django and Flask both use a variation on this for their “shell” commands too.  I think I’m going to try to use it to generate an automated quiz or homework for a python intro class (similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoHQIxJd-o&quot;&gt;the swirl package in R&lt;/a&gt;).  Have any other cool ways you’ve used this?  Let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Git Hooked on Git Hooks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I found something cool that either should be more popular than it is, or it is popular and it should be taught to new programmers sooner than it is.  They are called Git Hooks.  I’m going to write this post assuming you know what Git is, and assuming you’re comfortable with the general process of code, stage, commit, lather, rinse, repeat, push.  If you’re not, Here are a &lt;a href=&quot;http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/&quot;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sitepoint.com/git-for-beginners/&quot;&gt;good&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics&quot;&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt;.  (Note, those are three separate links, not one long one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-background&quot;&gt;The Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git hooks are scripts that, if enabled and set up properly, get fired at certain times in the git process.  Here is a list of the available hooks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pre-commit&lt;/code&gt;: Runs first, before a you even enter a commit message (assuming you don’t use -m for messages).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;prepare-commit-msg&lt;/code&gt;: Runs before displaying the commit message to you for editing.  This is good for templating commit messages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;commit-msg&lt;/code&gt;: Runs after you hit save on the commit message, but before the commit goes through.  Useful for enforcing commit message standards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post-commit&lt;/code&gt;: Runs after the commit is saved and completed.  Used for notifying or status updating usually.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pre-rebase&lt;/code&gt;: Runs before a rebase occurs.  Git’s default example script for this makes sure you haven’t pushed before you rebase (since that could cause issues for other people).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post-rewrite&lt;/code&gt;: Runs after a commit is replaced (e.g. with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git commit --amend&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git rebase&lt;/code&gt;).  Good for generating documentation or copying in untracked files.  Think &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; or similar, maybe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post-checkout&lt;/code&gt;: Runs after &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git checkout&lt;/code&gt;.  Similar to #6.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post-merge&lt;/code&gt;: Runs after &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git merge&lt;/code&gt;.  See #6.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pre-push&lt;/code&gt;: Happens before a push completes.  You can use it to abort the push if need be, similar to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pre-commit&lt;/code&gt;, but for pushes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these, there are a few hooks available for an email-based workflow (i.e. when people are emailing you patches to merge).  There are also a few available on the git server side that are useful for deployment.  I’m going to skip all of these for now, and just focus on a really basic case (mostly because that’s about where my skill level is at right now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hook-it-up&quot;&gt;Hook It UP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s do it!  For my example, I’m using Python because of course I am, shut up.  I’ll walk through this with you step by step.  First, create a new project folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/Desktop
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;mkdir hooky &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new Python file called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hooky.py&lt;/code&gt;.  Note that I’m going to purposefully use poor style for our example.  You’ll see why in a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# hooky.py&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;hook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;quantity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;---u&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;quantity&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;__main__&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;hook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s initialize our git repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git init
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git add hooky.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we commit, take a look at the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.git/hooks/&lt;/code&gt; directory.  Also, if you haven’t, install &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;flake8&lt;/code&gt;, which is one of many linters for Python.  If you’re following along in another language, install an equivalent linter.  Normally, we’d use a virtual environment, but a linter is a handy thing to have around globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ls -l .git/hooks/
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;pip3 install flake8
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll see a bunch of samples that you should look through later.  They’ve got some neat ideas in them.  For now, we’ll create our own &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pre-commit&lt;/code&gt; hook.  Create &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.git/hooks/pre-commit&lt;/code&gt;.  Make sure there is no file extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/usr/bin/env bash&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# This is the pre-commit file&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Linting code before commit...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
flake8
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, make sure that your script is executeable and we can attempt to commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git commit  &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# omit the -m for example's sake.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# if you include a message, it will still work&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# you'll just waste your time typing a message&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boom!  Flake8 complains about our 💩 style.  No commit.  Prove it with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git status&lt;/code&gt;.  Note the files are still staged, but not commited.  But why no commit?  For &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pre-commit&lt;/code&gt; hooks, if the script exits with any other status but zero, it cancels the commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/git-cancel.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Cancelled!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;prepare-commit-msg&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;commit-msg&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pre-rebase&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pre-push&lt;/code&gt; all do similar things.  That’s pretty much it!  Great right?  Go forth and hook away!  Just to drive this home, I want to illustrate one more similar use case.  This is extra, so feel free to skip it if you’re already too excited you can’t wait to try it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus-example&quot;&gt;Bonus Example&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create two new files: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;__init__.py&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;test_hooky.py&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;__init__.py&lt;/code&gt; will remain blank, but here are the contents of the test file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;hooky&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;hooky&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# From this dir, import the module&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# This test should pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;test_hook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;hooky&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;hook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;---u&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;---u&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;---u&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# This one will fail because there is no such method (yet).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;test_release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;hooky&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;---u&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, update your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.git/hooks/pre-commit&lt;/code&gt; file.  Again, if you haven’t yet, intall pytest (an awesome testing framework) via pip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/usr/bin/env bash&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# This is the pre-commit file&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Linting code before commit...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
flake8

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Running tests...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
pytest
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, running &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;flake8&lt;/code&gt;, go back into your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hooky.py&lt;/code&gt; file and fix all of the warnings until &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;flake8&lt;/code&gt; is appeased.  Then try committing again.  You should see it blow up with the broken test!  Feel cool?  Good, because you are cool.  And it’s not just the git hooks.  Although they add to your overall coolness, you were already cool.  So how about that?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Script as a Service</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m going to show you how I got a Python script to run as a service on Ubuntu.  I was working on a project of mine that is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rpalo/fanbot&quot;&gt;Twitter Bot that tweets compliments at people&lt;/a&gt;.  I wrote a (slightly disjointed) &lt;a href=&quot;http://assertnotmagic.com/2017/05/01/fanbot-and-doing-new-things-right.html&quot;&gt;post about it&lt;/a&gt; a little while ago, if you want more background.  Basically, I have this bot running in a Python script, and I want this Python script to run for a long time.  I definitely want to be able to kick it off and log out of my server!  So I went in search of some options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-options&quot;&gt;The Options&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Never log out of the server.  Run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;python main.py&lt;/code&gt; and leave the shell open.  Pros: very easy to do, and I already knew how to do it.  Cons: probably won’t work for long.  I assume ssh connections time out eventually.  Also, logging becomes an extra step of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;python main.py | tee fanbot.log&lt;/code&gt; or something of that nature.  All in all, feels hacky.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nohup&lt;/code&gt;.  A HUP (hangup) signal is sent to any job if its controlling terminal is closed.  One example of this is logging out of an SSH session or closing an open terminal window.  This causes it to wrap up and shut down.  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nohup&lt;/code&gt; is a command that tells a job to ignore the HUP signal.  I would be able to do &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nohup python main.py &amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;.  The &amp;amp; pushes the job to the background.  The job then runs in the background and appends all output to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nohup.out&lt;/code&gt;.  You can get a custom logfile thusly: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nohup python main.py &amp;gt; custom.log &amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;.  Pros: I can log out, I get logfiles where I want them, fairly simple command.  Cons: Dies if the server resets.  I’m also not sure how cleanly it could be killed.  It would at least be a couple commands to get it done properly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use a terminal multiplexer.  I could use something like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tmux&lt;/code&gt; to run in.  For those of you that don’t know what &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tmux&lt;/code&gt; is, it’s a neat way of saving and reusing terminal window, pane, and histories.  You can attach and detach from a tmux session whenever you want, but the programs running in the session stay running.  I’ll have to add a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tmux&lt;/code&gt; overview to my list of things to write.  It would go like this.  Pros: Easy to use.  Works basically just like running things in the terminal.  Cons: Also dies if the server resets.  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tmux&lt;/code&gt; feels like a little bit of overkill just to manage this one single job.  If you’re interested, here’s how that would go down:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;tmux new -s fanbot_session
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;python main.py | tee fanbot.log
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;ctrl-b&amp;gt;d &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# To detach from tmux&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Later, to check on things:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;tmux attach -t fanbot_session
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-pride-ourselves-on-service&quot;&gt;We Pride Ourselves on Service&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I gave in.  I had been putting off doing it as a service because it sounded hard and scary, even if it sounded like maybe it was the “right” way of doing things.  Turns out, it’s not that bad.  But, I hear what you are thinking: less talk, more examples!  Let us say that we have the script below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# /home/ryan/bigben.py&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;bong&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;BONG!  It is now {}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ctime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;__main__&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bong&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Tell the time once an hour&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kind of silly, but it is the type of script that you’d like to run for a long time, possibly be auto-restarted, and see the logs later.  OK.  So we’ll only need one other file: the service’s Unit File!  Create a file called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bong.service&lt;/code&gt;.  The .service is not really needed, but I think it’s nice to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ini highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;; /home/ryan/bong.service
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;[Unit]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Bong time telling service&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;After&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;multi-user.target&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;[Service]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;idle&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;ExecStart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;/usr/local/bin/python /home/ryan/bigben.py&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;[Install]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;WantedBy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;multi-user.target&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some explanation.  The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Unit&lt;/code&gt; section describes what this service is and how it should be run.  The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;After&lt;/code&gt; variable tells this service when is allowed to run.  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;After=multi-user.target&lt;/code&gt; essentially just means that this service will be ok to run once the server is ready for logging in.  The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Service&lt;/code&gt; section desribes what &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;systemd&lt;/code&gt; (the service controller) will do and how.  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Type=idle&lt;/code&gt; tells it to only run our service once there are no more jobs to run.  The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ExecStart&lt;/code&gt; variable is the command we would want it to run.  Note that absolute paths are required.  Lastly, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Install&lt;/code&gt; section allows us to have our service auto-run at boot.  The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WantedBy&lt;/code&gt; variable tells it which already auto-run service our service should get started after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy our service file into the systemd service library, setup permissions, load it up, and let er rip!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;sudo cp bong.service /lib/systemd/system/bong.service
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;sudo chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/bong.service
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;sudo systemctl daemon-reload  &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Refresh the available service list&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;sudo systemctl &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;enable &lt;/span&gt;bong.service

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Now watch your service auto run at bootup&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;sudo reboot
...
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;sudo systemctl status bong.service
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Blah blah blah you should see something happy and green&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Want to check your logs?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;sudo journalctl -e -u bong.service
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# -e scrolls to the end of the logs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# -u bong.service filters by the service that we care about&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# OR: sudo journalctl -f -u bong.service to follow, similar to tail -f&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s really it!  Create a service file, pop it in the right directory, and tell &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;systemd&lt;/code&gt; about it.  Not as hard as I thought!  And you get auto-restarting, sane log files, easy status checks.  As you can see, this applies not just to Python, but to any language, script, program, etc. that you can run from the command line.  It should work with Ruby, Bash, Node, and more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus-virtual-environments&quot;&gt;Bonus: Virtual Environments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re one of the cool kids, you’re programming Python in a virtual environment.  You may usually do something like the following to run your script by hand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;python -m venv .venv  &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Creating a virtual environment in .venv/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; .venv/bin/activate
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;.venv&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;which python
/home/ryan/.venv/bin/python
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;.venv&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;python bigben.py
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How, you ask me excitedly, do you get the service to run from within your virtual environment?  It’s simpler than you might think!  Remember this line in our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bong.service&lt;/code&gt; file?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ini highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;ExecStart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;/usr/local/bin/python /home/ryan/bigben.py&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply point the python path to your virtual environment.  It will automatically pick up the installed packages from there as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ini highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;ExecStart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;/home/ryan/.venv/bin/python /home/ryan/bigben.py&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this post provides you a useful &lt;em&gt;service&lt;/em&gt;!  (Womp womp womp)&lt;/p&gt;
